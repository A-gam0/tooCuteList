## Urgent Problems:
- [ ] make the focus on the title of the prompt when it shows up
- [ ] the logo goes right when the 'menu' button changes it's text to 'close' since it's somehow shorter
- [ ] add the tab title in the head + check missing meta tags
## Problems to Solve:
- [ ] Change the carousel tasks areas, they look awful
- [ ] Made another uneccessary div for the carousel overflow
- [ ] Change the landing tasks' text
- [ ] The padding-top/margin-top of the element under the logo is not dynamic
- [ ] Change `querySelector` with `getElementById`, using multiple html files it's hard to choose specific elements
- [ ] title doesn't perserve it's place when it's empty and the paragraph is not empty
## Want to Add:
- [ ] Cosider the timeline of the task added (prepend vs append)
- [ ] make the 'not functional yet' hover effect follow the cursor
- [ ] Scroll on task to make a flip animation that makes that task marked as "done"
- [ ] Make 'guide tour' on how to use the website
