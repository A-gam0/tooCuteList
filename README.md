# Problems:

- change the carousel tasks areas, they look awful
1. clicked/dumped tasks in the carousel suddenly reappear when the animation is repeated

2. made another uneccessary div for the carousel overflow

3. the hamburger menu animation is slack!

4. change the landing tasks' text

5. add click animation to the landing (burger, sign-in, getstarted) buttons/anchors

6. the padding top of margin bottom of the cat oval shape is a pain in the neck!!!

7. should the tasks be prepended or appended!

8. in the JS files that why we use id's, because in multiple html files it's hard to choose using classes as they refere to multiple elements




# want to add:
1. scroll on task to make a flip animation that makes that task marked as "done"

2. guide tour animation for the website

3. change the logo when ever a task gets marked as "done"


4. click on the pic to change it, everytime a task is done / everytime a task is deleted / eveytime a task is edited
