# Problems to Solve:
1. Change the carousel tasks areas, they look awful.
2. Made another uneccessary div for the carousel overflow.
3. Change the landing tasks' text.
4. The padding-top/margin-top of the element under the logo is not dynamic.
5. Change `querySelector` with `getElementById`, using multiple html files it's hard to choose specific elements.

# Want to Add:
1. Cosider the timeline of the task added (prepend vs append).
2. Scroll on task to make a flip animation that makes that task marked as "done".
2. Make 'guide tour' on how to use the website.
3. Change the logo everytime (a task get's done/deleted/edited) or when the logo is actually clicked.
